* INTRODUCTION *

This library of php classes is created for connecting to the LinkedIn Api. As
an example there is a folder example in this package. I distribute this under 
the GNU GPL license. Please send me your comments, code reviews or wannahaves.

You can contact me at w.peereboom@developmentit.com

* INSTALL *

1. To use these classes you have to setup a server with PHP 5 (www.php.net)

2. These classes uses the pecl lib Oauth. Install these within your PHP extensions
   commandline (l)unix: pecl install oauth-beta
   
3. Make sure sessions are enabled.   

4. Add/Edit the /includes/config.php with your api key and customer key/secret
   (I have descided to add the callback url in this config as well. If you entered
   this in the linkedIn api registration you can leave this empty)
   
5. Open with a browser the /example/index.php file

Pray everything is working ;)
